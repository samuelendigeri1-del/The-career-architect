Career - Architect | AI-Powered Education Mentorship
Career - Architect is a next-generation educational consultancy tool designed for Bullstar Scholars LLP. Unlike traditional static websites, this interactive Single Page Application (SPA) acts as a 24/7 "Digital Agent" for CEO Samuel Samson.

It leverages Google's Gemini API to democratize access to elite "Talent Mining" mentorship, allowing students to receive instant, AI-driven feedback on their profiles, resumes, and study abroad aspirations.
